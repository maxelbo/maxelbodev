I contributed to the UI/UX design and frontend development of **Shibuya My Portal**, a CRM app designed to simplify and digitize interactions between citizens, businesses, and the municipal office in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, as a part of the ward's Digital Transformation initiative.

I developed a full-functional prototype with Node.js, WebPack, Pug, SCSS, and JavaScript, which was then reused for production using Salesforce's LWC. Once launched, I worked with LWC on Experience Cloud improving the UI based on requirements from the client.

Additionally, I made illustrations for the landing page to enhance the user interface and experience.
