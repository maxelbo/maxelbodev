I was responsible for the UI/UX design and frontend development of the **Narakko Hagukumi App**, a CRM app developed to assist parents in Nara Prefecture, Japan, with child-rearing resources and support.

I developed a full-functional prototype with Node.js, WebPack, Pug, SCSS, and JavaScript, which was then reused for production using Salesforce's LWC.

In addition to technical development, I created illustrations for the app’s hero image and onboarding screens to facilitate a user-friendly experience for parents navigating through the platform.
