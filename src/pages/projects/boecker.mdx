A campaign for Boecker with me as Art Director at **J. Walter Thompson Dubai**
with **Tall + Short** as production house.
The illustrations were painted on wood by **Carmine Bellucci**,
a traditional painter based in Milan,
and then placed on CGI sculptures.
It won a Silver and two Bronzes at **Dubai Lynx** 2017,
a bronze at the **New York Festivals**,
and one of them got to be print ad of the week in **Lürzer's Archive**.
It was also chosen as the front cover in 2021 for an illustration special.
