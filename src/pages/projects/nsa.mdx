I worked on the design and frontend development for a super-app for **Nara Prefecture**.

I developed a fully functional prototype, which was then reused for production. For prototyping some pages, I used LWC in a local environment, running LWR Node.js. Once the sandbox was ready, I also developed components directly in the Salesforce sandbox.

I also made illustrations of the prefectural icons to appear randomly on the app's splash screen at launch. Each icon is assigned a specific weight, ensuring that certain special icons, such as our beloved Sento-kun, the prefectural mascot, appear exclusively for lucky users.
