body: "I combined my portfolio and blog into this site to simplify things. I'm using Astro, Tailwind, and I'm using React for some components. I'm deploying it on my own VPS in Nurenberg, and using Github webhooks to redeploy it every time I push to the repo. I started using Netlify first, but decided to self-host it with Coolify. I'm enjoying the new setup a lot."
