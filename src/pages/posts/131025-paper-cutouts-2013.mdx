body: "Playing with paper cutouts. That little black thing, inside the nautilus, is a ship. A ship in the middle of the ocean inside a nautilus drifting with the tide inside a man’s head. And this last one is done with random pieces of ripped paper. They’re some kind of middle eastern gnomish creatures visiting their forest dwelling relatives, I guess."
