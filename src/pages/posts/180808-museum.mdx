body: At Amplifier we had the chance to work on an interactive animation exhibited at the Tokyo National Museum thanks to our client Prototype Inc. I drew the parts that you can’t see in the woodblock print and animated some birds flying by. The main animation was done by Toshiyuki Kuwabara (pictures by Prototype).
