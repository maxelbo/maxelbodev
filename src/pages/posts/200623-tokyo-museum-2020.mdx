  I worked on a projection mapping for the Tokyo National Museum, showcasing one of Japan's national treasures—the 紙本著色花下遊楽図 (Merry-making under Aronia Blossoms), a folding screen masterpiece by Kano Naganobu, dating back to the Momoyama Period. I worked on the animation of the characters and the ceiling. The project was led by Prototype, and I worked as a member of the Amplifier team.
