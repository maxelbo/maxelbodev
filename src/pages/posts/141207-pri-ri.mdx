body: "I was commissioned by Beletra Almanako —an esperanto literary magazine— to make a two page diagram explaining the difference between gender identity, sex, sexual or romantic orientation and gender expression for an article about riism (the use of a third gender pronoun) by Egalecen. Here I'm posting the online version.

Thanks to Vesper, Aaron, Mo and Mia for the help!"
